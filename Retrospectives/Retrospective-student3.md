## Experience

I tested my project through a couple web browsers before and after merging. I put in different values for my database and inserting/updating/deleting comments in as many different orders as I could think of trying to get it to break.  I also manually checked my team's pages before and after to make sure nothing I did broke their stuff.

I struggled for a few hours with figuring out how to pass the entered data to update a comment from the form into the database in pug/js. I feel silly after finally finding the solution and learning the syntax.

Yes, I was able to get the entire project done.

## Known issues or Bugs

There is an image of a bug in my website called a spitter ;)  It's a native to Nauvis.  Other than that, no bugs or issues that I know of.

## Sources used

I googled for solutions for few hours all around the internet trying things, but the solution ended up being found on https://stackoverflow.com/
