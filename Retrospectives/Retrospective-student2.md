## Experience

- This was a particularly difficult project. I completed the previous four modules in the first month of the semester. So, I had to relearn some thing coming back for this final project.
- I am pretty good with HTML and CSS, but JavaScript is a language I do not practice much. I can make frontend projects with the language, but I have no experience with backend logic.
- It is difficult to write in a language when you are not able to read. So, this was quite the crash course in backend JavaScript. Thankfully it was a group project where we could use each other's working code, and then configure it to our specific code layout.
- I have not used Git or GitHub very much. So all of the pushing, pulling, and merging was a nightmare to do in the correct order and correct direction. It will take a lot more experience to get good with it.

## Known issues or Bugs

- Most of my bugs was in the backend JavaScript. I had trouble rendering the comments page. The other part was redirecting to the comments page when adding/editing/deleting comments. The most trouble though was making sure the comment logic worked and saved.

## Sources used

- Teammates code and configured to my code logic.
