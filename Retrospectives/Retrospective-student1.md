## Experience

I found this assignment a little confusing to be honest, I did not think about how I was supposed to update comments. The updating process was the hardest part by far. I figure that 
I am allowed to use my previous assignments code and since it got 100% grade I did end up using it. However for the updating portion of the assignment I had a little more trouble.
I was very close a large portion of the time with the sql statements but could not find the situation that would update the right portions of the comments. I was originally
testing my website through the main 3000 web server, this got really tedious as I would test something on the comments page and it would crash. I would then have to 
restart from the beginning of the webpages to navigate again to the comments page and it was a whole mess. I ended up keeping a tab that was always on the comments page to streamline this.
I learned a lot about SQl in this project, trying to figure out to access and update what data so the comment section works was really something.

## Known issues or Bugs

I could not find any.

## Sources used

Zybooks and discussion between my teammates. I also used google to look for interesting color schemes.
