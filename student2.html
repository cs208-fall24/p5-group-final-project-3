    <h2>Location:</h2>
            <p>
                We are located on the Light Side of the Moon. This allows for our students to experience total freedom in testing their prototypes as well as quick and easy access to internships.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike our Dark Moon University, we offer a very energetic and bright campus to tour and a lovely view over the gardens and orchards from the dorms.
            </p>
